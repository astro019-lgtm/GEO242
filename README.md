# GEO242
This is to deposit my code I create for the GEO242 final project.

## What am I doing?

I don't know.

## No, for real.

I am creating a code that will determine the deepest and shallowest I theortically can image with seismic station arrays for ambient noise tomography. This requires getting coordinates from Google Earth, plotting those points to show the array, plotting all the possible combinations of ray paths between stations, calculating the distances of those, and getting my shortest and longest distances. I then calculate the peak sensitivity, maximum sensitivity, lateral, and vertical resolutions for those to get an approximation of the limits of the array design.
