	abstract = {The tectonically active East Sierra Valley System (ESVS), which comprises the westernmost part of the Walker Lane-Eastern California Shear Zone, marks the boundary between the highly extended Basin and Range Province and the largely coherent Sierra Nevada-Great Valley microplate (SN-GVm), which is moving relatively NW. The recent history of the ESVS is characterized by oblique extension partitioned between NNW-striking normal and strike-slip faults oriented at an angle to the more northwesterly relative motion of the SN-GVm. Spatially variable extension and right-lateral shear have resulted in a longitudinally segmented valley system composed of diverse geomorphic and structural elements, including a discontinuous series of deep basins detected through analysis of isostatic gravity anomalies. Extension in the ESVS probably began in the middle Miocene in response to initial westward movement of the SN-GVm relative to the Colorado Plateau. At ca. 3–3.5 Ma, the SN-GVm became structurally separated from blocks directly to the east, resulting in significant basin-forming deformation in the ESVS. We propose a structural model that links high-angle normal faulting in the ESVS with coeval low-angle detachment faulting in adjacent areas to the east.},

	abstract = {Magnetic anomaly patterns in the northeast Pacific Ocean combined with plate theory indicate that a trench existed offshore from western North America during mid-Tertiary time and that the present episode of strike-slip motion in the San Andreas fault system originated after the cessation of subduction, not earlier than 30 m.y. ago. At present, the American and Pacific plates appear to be moving past one another parallel to the San Andreas fault at a rate of 6 cm/yr. Data concerning the late Cenozoic history of motions between these plates is inconclusive, and so 2 probable models are examined. One assumes a constant motion of 6 cm/yr throughout the late Cenozoic, whereas the other assumes that the 2 plates were fixed with respect to one another until 5 m.y. ago, at which time they broke along the San Andreas fault system and began moving at 6 cm/yr. The second model implies that the San Andreas fault took up all the motion at the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates, while the first model suggests the broader view that much of the late Cenozoic tectonic activity of western North America is related to this boundary deformation. The models make testable predictions for the distribution of igneous rocks and for the total amount and timing of deformation expected. Extrapolation of the model of constant motions to the early Cenozoic suggests an era of slightly compressional strike-slip at the edge of North America. A major change in plate motions in late Mesozoic time is suggested.},

Processes that modify the lithosphere include subduction, terrane accretion, orogenesis, rifting, volcanism/magmatism, lithospheric loss or delamination, small-scale or edge-driven convection, and plume-lithosphere interaction. The eastern North American margin (ENAM) provides an exceptional locale to study this broad suite of processes, having undergone multiple complete Wilson cycles of supercontinent formation and dispersal, along with ∼200 Ma of postrift evolution. Moreover, recent data collection efforts associated with EarthScope, GeoPRISMS, and related projects have led to a wealth of new observations in eastern North America. Here I highlight recent advances in our understanding of the structure of the continental lithosphere beneath eastern North America and the processes that have modified it through geologic time, with a focus on recent geophysical imaging that has illuminated the lithosphere in unprecedented detail. ▪ Eastern North America experienced a range of processes that deform, destroy, or modify continental lithosphere, providing new insights into how lithosphere evolves through time. ▪ Subduction and terrane accretion, continental rifting, and postrift evolution have all played a role in shaping lithospheric structure beneath eastern North America. ▪ Relict structures from past tectonic events are well-preserved in ENAM lithosphere; however, lithospheric modification that postdates the breakup of Pangea has also been significant.},

	abstract = {Plate motions in Southern California have undergone a transition from compressional and extensional regimes to a dominantly strike‐slip regime in the Miocene. Strike‐slip motion is most easily accommodated on vertical faults, and major transform fault strands in the region are typically mapped as near vertical on the surface. However, some previous work suggests that these faults have a dipping geometry at depth. We analyze receiver function arrivals that vary harmonically with back azimuth at all available broadband stations in the region. The results show a dominant signal from contrasts in dipping foliation as well as dipping isotropic velocity contrasts from all crustal depths, including from the ductile middle to lower crust. We interpret these receiver function observations as a dipping fault‐parallel structural fabric that is pervasive throughout the region. The strike of these structures and fabrics is parallel to that of nearby fault surface traces. We also plot microseismicity on depth proﬁles perpendicular to major strike‐slip faults and ﬁnd consistently NE dipping features in seismicity changing from near vertical (80–85°) on the Elsinore Fault in the Peninsular Ranges to 60–65° slightly further inland on the San Jacinto Fault to 50–55° on the San Andreas Fault. Taken together, the dipping features in seismicity and in rock fabric suggest that preexisting fabrics and faults may have acted as strain guides in the modern slip regime, with reactivation and growth of strike‐slip faults along northeast dipping fabrics both above and below the brittle‐ductile transition. Plain Language Summary In Southern California, blocks of the Earth's crust move horizontally past each other along the San Andreas Fault and other major faults. Simple mechanics concepts dictate that such fault zones should be oriented vertically with depth. By looking at the locations of small earthquakes along the fault zones and from imaging texture in the rock using seismograms, we instead ﬁnd that the fault zones tend to dip away from the vertical in the subsurface. They also parallel features and rock fabric formed in previous geological events. We conclude that the geological history of a region can control its deformation behavior in the present.},

	abstract = {Abstract We introduce a new algorithm for joint inversion of body wave and surface wave data to get better 3-D P wave (Vp) and S wave (Vs) velocity models by taking advantage of the complementary strengths of each data set. Our joint inversion algorithm uses a one-step inversion of surface wave traveltime measurements at different periods for 3-D Vs and Vp models without constructing the intermediate phase or group velocity maps. This allows a more straightforward modeling of surface wave traveltime data with the body wave arrival times. We take into consideration the sensitivity of surface wave data with respect to Vp in addition to its large sensitivity to Vs, which means both models are constrained by two different data types. The method is applied to determine 3-D crustal Vp and Vs models using body wave and Rayleigh wave data in the Southern California plate boundary region, which has previously been studied with both double-difference tomography method using body wave arrival times and ambient noise tomography method with Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity dispersion measurements. Our approach creates self-consistent and unique models with no prominent gaps, with Rayleigh wave data resolving shallow and large-scale features and body wave data constraining relatively deeper structures where their ray coverage is good. The velocity model from the joint inversion is consistent with local geological structures and produces better fits to observed seismic waveforms than the current Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) model.},

	abstract = {Abstract We investigate the existence of bimaterial interfaces along the San Jacinto fault zone (SJFZ) and the San Andreas fault (SAF) around their intersection at Cajon Pass (CP) to clarify if large earthquakes can rupture simultaneously parts of both faults. Analysis of fault zone head waves reveals a bimaterial interface along the northern SJFZ with a {\textgreater}7.5\% velocity contrast (slower northeast side) that extends continuously through and perhaps slightly beyond CP. Other seismological studies show an opposite sense of velocity contrast across the nearby SAF. These observations, combined with expected properties of bimaterial ruptures, suggest that large earthquakes on the northern SJFZ are likely to propagate to the southeast and hence unlikely to trigger large SAF events. However, large earthquakes propagating on the SAF near CP can trigger continuing rupture on the SJFZ to the southeast. This inference is consistent with ruptures of large paleoseismic earthquakes and directivities of smaller events.},

	abstract = {We use new space geodetic data from very long baseline interferometry and satellite laser ranging combined with other geodetic and geologic data to study contemporary deformation in the Basin and Range province of the western United States. Northwest motion of the central Sierra Nevada block relative to stable North America, a measure of integrated Basin and Range deformation, is 12.1±1.2 mm/yr oriented N38°W±5° (one standard error), in agreement with previous geological estimates within uncertainties. This velocity reflects both east-west extension concentrated in the eastern Basin and Range and north-northwest directed right lateral shear concentrated in the western Basin and Range. Ely, Nevada is moving west at 4.9±1.3 mm/yr relative to stable North America, consistent with dip-slip motion on the north striking Wasatch fault and other north striking normal faults. Comparison with ground-based geodetic data suggests that most of this motion is accommodated within ∼50 km of the Wasatch fault zone. Paleoseismic data for the Wasatch fault zone and slip rates based on seismic energy release in the region both suggest much lower slip rates. The discrepancy may be explained by some combination of additional deformation away from the Wasatch fault itself, aseismic slip, or a seismic rate that is anomalously low with respect to longer time averages. Deformation in the western Basin and Range province is also largely confined to a relatively narrow boundary zone and in our study area is partitioned into the eastern California shear zone, accommodating 10.7±1.6 mm/yr of north-northwest directed right-lateral shear, and a small component (∼1 mm/yr) of west-southwest - east-northeast extension. A slip rate budget for major strike-slip faults in our study area based on a combination of local geodetic or late Quaternary geologic data and the regional space geodetic data suggests the following rates of right-lateral slip: Owens Valley fault zone, 3.9±1.1 mm/yr; Death Valley-Furnace Creek fault zone, 3.3±2.2 mm/yr; White Mountains fault zone in northern Owens Valley, 3.4±1.2 mm/yr; Fish Lake Valley fault zone, 6.2±2.3 mm/yr. In the last few million years the locus of right-lateral shear in the region has shifted west and become more north trending as slip on the northwest striking Death Valley-Furnace Creek fault zone has decreased and is increasingly accommodated on the north-northwest striking Owens Valley fault zone.},

We use an elastic block model to relate GPS station velocities to long-term fault slip rate estimates. The model accounts for elastic strain accumulation on the San Andreas fault, as well as faults of the Eastern California shear zone. South of the Garlock fault, 14 mm/yr of dextral shear is distributed across the Eastern California shear zone. Some of this slip penetrates eastward into the Basin and Range, and a collective budget of 13 mm/yr is observed to the north at the latitude of Owens Lake. Model slip rates for two important faults, the Garlock and Owens Valley faults, significantly misfit geologic estimates. By referencing station velocities to stable North America we observe northward-increasing deformation east of our regional GPS network. At the latitude of Mojave Desert, however, some of this deformation is ascribed to elastic strain accumulation due to a locked San Andreas fault and thus does not represent additional fault-related, permanent deformation.},

Across the central WL, near 38°N latitude, the velocities with respect to North America increase westward by ∼10 mm/yr inducing dextral shear. Farther north between 40° and 41°N latitude, a western zone of ∼7 mm/yr relative motion undergoes dextral shear, and an eastern zone of ≤3 mm/yr relative motion undergoes extension and shear. These data show that the northern WL is essentially a dextral shear zone experiencing minor net dilatation (ɛΔ = 2.6 ± 0.8 nstrain/yr). Near most Holocene normal faults, dilatation inferred from the velocity field is not greater than the uncertainties. However, near the central Nevada seismic belt we detect significant dilatation expressed as extension in a direction approximately normal to the range fronts (ɛΔ = 23.0 ± 3.9 nstrain/yr), some of which is attributable to transient postseismic deformation following large historic earthquakes. A block model constrained by velocities corrected for transient effects shows that the sum of dextral slip rates across the Honey Lake, Warm Springs, east Pyramid fault system, and Mohawk Valley faults is ∼7 mm/yr. The WL is a zone whose width and dilatation rate increase northwestward, consistent with counterclockwise rotation of the Sierra Nevada microplate and transfer of deformation into the Pacific Northwest.},

GPS and earthquake focal mechanism studies demonstrate that the Walker Lane belt currently accommodates NW-SE–directed movement between the Sierra Nevada microplate and the North American plate, but the timing and nature of rift initiation remains unclear. I present a model for plate-margin-scale initiation of the Gulf of California and Walker Lane transtensional rifts at ca. 12 Ma; localization of rifting in both was initiated by thermal weakening in the axis of a subduction-related arc undergoing extension due to slab rollback, and thermal weakening in the arc was enhanced by stalling of the trenchward-migrating precursor arc against a thick Cretaceous batholithic lithospheric profile on its western margin. Rifting succeeded very quickly in the Gulf of California, due to stalling of Farallon slabs, but the Walker Lane transtensional rift has been unzipping northward along the axis of the Cascades arc, following the Mendocino triple junction. I infer that plate-margin-scale Walker Lane transtension was signaled by the development of an unusually large and voluminous transtensional arc volcanic center, the ca. 11.5–9 Ma Sierra Crest–Little Walker arc volcanic center. I show that the style of faulting in this large Miocene arc volcanic center closely matches that of Quaternary transtensional structures in the central Walker Lane, where it lies, and that it differs from southern and northern Walker Lane structures. This indicates that the temporal transition from E-W Basin and Range extension to NW-SE Walker Lane transtension occurred earlier than most workers have inferred. I also summarize new data which show that the central Sierra Nevada range front (from Long Valley to the Tahoe Basin) lies squarely within the Walker Lane belt, not to the west of it as previous workers have inferred.The leading tip of Walker Lane transtension is marked by large arc volcanic centers sited in transtensional stepovers; these include the ca. 11.5–9 Ma Sierra Crest–Little Walker volcanic center; north of that, the ca. 6.3–4.8 Ma Ebbetts Pass volcanic center; and north of that, the active Lassen volcanic center. In its wake, large rift volcanic centers are sited on transtensional stepovers or bends; these include the Long Valley and Coso volcanic fields. I predict that any \&lt;12 Ma large volcanic centers identified by future workers in the Sierra Nevada–Walker Lane region, or in the Gulf of California, will prove to be sited at major releasing bends or stepovers.},

Comparison between geologic and geodetic slip rates indicates that out of 12 published geologic rates, 10 agree with geodetic rates to within uncertainties. This suggests that smaller crustal blocks move steadily, similar to larger lithospheric plates, and that geodetic measurements of slip rates are reliable in zones of complex crustal deformation. For the two slip rates that disagree, geologic rates are greater. The vertical axis rotation rate of the Carson domain is ?1.3 ± 0.1°/My clockwise, lower than the 3° to 6°/My obtained in paleomagnetic measurements. This suggests that vertical axis rotation rates may have decreased over the last 9?13 My as the role of faulting has increased at the expense of rigid rotations.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract Cenozoic extension in the western United States presents a complex interrelation of extension, volcanism, and plate boundary tectonics that defeats simple notions of “active” or “passive” rifting. Forces driving extension can originate at plate boundaries, through basal traction, basal normal forces, or from buoyancy forces internal to the crust and lithospheric mantle. The latter two are most responsible for driving extension where it is observed in the Basin and Range. The complex evolution of the northern Basin and Range probably represents removal or alteration of mantle lithosphere interacting with buoyancy stored in the crust. In contrast, crustal buoyancy forces combined with a divergent plate boundary between about 28 and 16 Ma to drive extension in the southern Basin and Range. The central Basin and Range most likely extended as a result of boundary forces external to itself but arising from buoyancy forces elsewhere in the western United States.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Four groups of discrete element models (DEMs) were set-up to simulate and analyze the influence of regional erosion and sedimentary loading on the formation and spatial-temporal evolution of faults in the southern and central Longmen Shan (LMS) active fold-thrust belt. The interior characteristics of faults in the southern and central LMS fold-thrust belt were also evaluated during the interaction of tectonic processes and surface processes according to the stress-strain analysis from DEM results. The results showed that synkinematic erosion promoted the reactivation of pre-existing faults in thrust wedges and also retarded the formation and development of new incipient faults in the pre-wedge regions. Meanwhile, synkinematic sedimentation also delayed the development of new incipient faults in the pre-wedge regions by promoting the development of thrust faults in the front of thrust wedges, causing these thrust wedges in supercritical stages with relatively narrow wedge lengths. According to these DEM results, we infer that: 1) The characteristics of erosion and sedimentation in the central and southern LMS have important influences on the activities of large faults which are extended into the deep detachment layer; 2) Besides differential erosion, the differential sedimentary loading may also be one of the important factors for the along-strike differential evolution of the LMS fold-thrust belt. This kind of differential deposition may lead to differential fault activity and uplift in the interior thrust wedge and pre-wedge region in the central and southern LMS; 3) Compared to the northern LMS, the central LMS and southern LMS is more conducive to the occurrence of earthquakes, because of synkinematic sedimentation (such as the growth of Chengdu plain) has a greater blocking effect on the stress propagation and strain convergence on the fault planes of front faults of an active thrust wedge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Such events have been inferred to cause uplift and extensional deformation in areas around the world and back billions of years. Samples of garnet-rich mantle lithosphere from under the Sierra Nevada were brought up in basaltic eruptions from before 80 million years ago to approximately 8 million years ago but are absent from volcanics after about 3.5 million years ago [Ducea and Saleeby, 1998]. Granitic batholiths like the Sierra Nevada evolve from more quartz poor melts and thus have roots of mafic (quartz-poor) residuum that remain under the batholith. This residuum, metamorphosed to a dense garnet-rich rock, apparently sinks together with part of the mantle lithosphere below it at one or more locations beneath the Great Valley.},

	abstract = {21 well-distributed teleseisms (30° to 100° distance) were recorded by mixed broad-band (BB) and short-period (SP) seismic arrays at Mineral King (MK) and Horseshoe Meadow (HM) in the southern Sierra Nevada and at Darwin Plateau (DP) between the Inyo and Argus ranges. These arrays permit identification and separation of direct P and S arrivals, reflections from topography, scattered energy, and arrivals from different back azimuths (multipath arrivals). P-to-S conversions can be identified from beamed BB or SP seismograms. Least squares time domain processing recovered single-event receiver functions from these beamed seismograms. Converted phases attributable to the Moho are clear and uncomplicated at DP; Ps-P times of 3.9?4.2 s correspond to crustal thicknesses of 31?33 km, assuming a mean P crustal velocity of 6.2 km/s and a Poisson's ratio (?) of 0.255. Ps-P times at HM (eastern Sierra) are 3.9?4.6 s (32?37 km) excepting some unusual seismograms from events at back azimuths of 225°?239°. MK (western Sierra) times for Ps-P show a strong E-W asymmetry: 3.9?4.1 s (31?33 km) from the east, and 4.8?5.3 s (39?42 km) from the west. The MK arrivals from the east are multiple and substantially weaker by comparison with HM and DP. These results confirm the absence of a thick crust under the southern High Sierra inferred from both a refraction experiment coincident with this experiment and some earlier studies. At DP the Moho event follows an intracrustal negative polarity event defining the top of an S wave low-velocity zone. This feature dips west under the Sierran crest at HM but is absent farther west at MK. This feature appears to be a manifestation of extensional strain and thus indicates that the surficially undeformed Sierra overlies a tectonized lower crust. Sub-Moho energy is absent under the Basin and Range (DP) but is conspicuous under the High Sierra at positive arrivals ?7.3 s (MK) and ?9 s (HM) after the P. These arrivals might be from the base of a low-velocity, low-density upper mantle body supporting the Sierra.},

The estimated depth of melting correlates strongly with some trace element ratios in the magmas (e.g., Ce/Pb, Ba/La), with deeper melts having values closer to upper mantle asthenosphere values, and shallower melts having values more typical of subduction zone magmas. This geochemical stratification is consistent with seismic observations of a shallow lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary (∼55 km depth).

Basin terms use the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA)-West-2 ground-motion models (GMMs) as reference models and use their functional forms with slight modifications. We investigate the use of two approaches to incorporate the time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30?m (VS30) in these calculations and find that the use of site-specific and uniform VS30 has minor effects on the resulting basin terms for this data set. By centering the simulated ground motions on the basin terms, we separate the information from the simulations about absolute ground-motion level from information relating to the relative amplifications, such as the differences between shallow- and deep-basin sites. Recent observations from sedimentary basins of southern California indicate that additional amplification effect may persist at relatively shallow basin depths (i.e. the GMM basin terms should have positive values when differential depths, δZ1, are near zero), and we present models for ?centered? and ?adjusted? basin-depth scaling models that reflect this potential. The simulation-modified GMMs are appropriate for crustal sources and for deep-basin sites (δZ1{\textgreater}0) within basins of the Greater Los Angeles region, for the magnitudes and distances defined by each of the reference NGA-West-2 GMMs.},

	abstract = {The Poverty Hills are a 5 km2, 300-m-high mass of plutonic and meta-sedimentary rocks exposed along the axis of the alluviated Owens Valley graben in eastern California. Two models have been proposed for the origin of the hills. One model suggests the hills represent a transpressional uplift along a 3-km leftstep in the right-lateral Owens Valley fault zone, and the other proposes that the hills are a long-runout rockavalanche deposit. This article argues that the rockavalanche hypothesis best fits the geology. The transpressional model is problematic because the fault segment to which right-lateral displacement is purportedly transferred has been shown to have pure dip-slip displacement. The rock-avalanche model is based primarily on lithologic evidence. Throughout the hills are scattered outcrops displaying mosaic, jigsaw, and crackle breccia textures, all of which are characteristic of rock-avalanche deposits. Also, well-exposed roadcut outcrops display preserved source-rock bedding within the matrix-poor breccia framework. Though preserved, the bedding has been contorted and distorted by cataclastic flow of the breccia, another common characteristic of rock-avalanche deposits created during emplacement. The landslide is younger than 3 Ma, the age of inception of the Owens Valley graben, and older than 640 6 50 ka, the age of a basalt flow that post-dates the landslide. An area in the Inyo Mountains southeast of the hills appears to be the most likely source. Interpretation of the Poverty Hills as a landslide mass suggests an alternative model for the Owens Valley fault-zone kinematics.},

The estimated depth of melting correlates strongly with some trace element ratios in the magmas (e.g., Ce/Pb, Ba/La), with deeper melts having values closer to upper mantle asthenosphere values, and shallower melts having values more typical of subduction zone magmas. This geochemical stratification is consistent with seismic observations of a shallow lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary (∼55 km depth). Combined trace element and cryoscopic melting models yield self‐consistent estimates for the degree of melting (∼5\%) and source H

	abstract = {Abstract
            The 2020 Mw 5.8 Lone Pine earthquake, the largest earthquake on the Owens Valley fault zone, eastern California, since the nineteenth century, ruptured an extensional stepover in that fault. Owens Valley separates two normal-faulting regimes, the western margin of the Great basin and the eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada, forming a complex seismotectonic zone, and a possible nascent plate boundary. Foreshocks began on 22 June 2020; the largest Mw 4.7 foreshock occurred at ∼6  km depth, with primarily normal faulting, followed ∼40  hr later on 24 June 2020 by an Mw 5.8 mainshock at ∼7  km depth. The sequence caused overlapping ruptures across a ∼0.25  km2 area, extended to ∼4  km2, and culminated in an ∼25  km2 aftershock area. The mainshock was predominantly normal faulting, with a strike of 330° (north-northwest), dipping 60°–65° to the east-northeast. Comparison of background seismicity and 2020 Ridgecrest aftershock rates showed that this earthquake was not an aftershock of the Ridgecrest mainshock. The Mw–mB relationship and distribution of ground motions suggest typical rupture speeds. The aftershocks form a north-northwest-trending, north-northeast-dipping, 5 km long distribution, consistent with the rupture length estimated from analysis of regional waveform data. No surface rupture was reported along the 1872 scarps from the 2020 Mw 5.8 mainshock, although, the dipping rupture zone of the Mw 5.8 mainshock projects to the surface in the general area. The mainshock seismic energy triggered rockfalls at high elevations (\&gt;3.0  km) in the Sierra Nevada, at distances of 8–20 km, and liquefaction along the western edge of Owens Lake. Because there were ∼30\% fewer aftershocks than for an average southern California sequence, the aftershock forecast probabilities were lower than expected. ShakeAlert, the earthquake early warning system, provided first warning within 9.9 s, as well as subsequent updates.},

	abstract = {We use updated rotations within the Pacific-Antarctica-Africa-North America plate circuit to calculate Pacific-North America plate reconstructions for times since chron 13 (33 Ma). The direction of motion of the Pacific plate relative to stable North America was fairly steady between chrons 13 and 4, and then changed and moved in a more northerly direction from chron 4 to the present (8 Ma to the present). No Pliocene changes in Pacific-North America plate motion are resolvable in these data, suggesting that Pliocene changes in deformation style along the boundary were not driven by changes in plate motion. However, the chron 4 change in Pacific-North America plate motion appears to correlate very closely to a change in direction of extension documented between the Sierra Nevada and the Colorado Plateau. Our best solution for the displacement with respect to stable North America of a point on the Pacific plate that is now near the Mendocino triple junction is that from 30 to 12 Ma the point was displaced along an azimuth of {\textasciitilde} N 6 0 ° W at rate of {\textasciitilde} 3 3 m m / y r ; from 12 Ma to about 8 Ma the azimuth of displacement was about the same as previously, but the rate was faster ({\textasciitilde}52 m m / y r ) ; and since 8 Ma the point was displaced along an azimuth of N 3 7 ° W at a rate of {\textasciitilde} 5 2 mm/yr. We compare plate-circuit reconstructions of the edge of the Pacific plate to continental deformation reconstructions of North American tectonic elements across the Basin and Range province and elsewhere in order to evaluate the relationship of this deformation to the plate motions. The oceanic displacements correspond remarkably well to the continental reconstruc­ tions where deformations of the latter have been quantified along a path across the Colorado Plateau and central California. They also supply strong constraints for the deformation budgets of regions to the north and south, in Cascadia and northern Mexico, respectively.},

	abstract = {The large Palaeozoic continent of Laurentia was largely in North America, but included parts of modern Europe. It was independent from late Neoproterozoic times at about 570 Ma until it merged with Avalonia–Baltica in the 430–420 Ma Silurian Caledonide Orogeny, after which it formed the major western sector of the combined Laurussia Supercontinent. Laurussia in turn became part of the even larger Pangea Supercontinent in the Late Carboniferous, as documented by the oblique Laurussia–Gondwana collision seen in the Laurentian sector in the Ouachita Orogeny. Laurentia's margins and the many peri-Laurentian terranes are reviewed. Those parts of northeast Siberia which today form parts of the North America Plate, but were not part of Laurentia or Laurussia in the Palaeozoic, are also reviewed. A revised Apparent Polar Wander Path (APW) for the Laurentian Craton is presented for all of the Palaeozoic. Laurentia was at equatorial palaeolatitudes throughout and rotated little, apart from shortly after its collision with Avalonia–Baltica in the Silurian Caledonide Orogeny; however, in contrast, its position and orientation were much less affected in the Ouachita Orogeny at the time of Pangean assembly. The Laurentian Craton was variably ﬂooded at many times with epeiric seas, which formed optimal numbers of ecological niches which in turn encouraged animal speciation and evolution. A summary is presented of the Palaeozoic geological history of Laurentia and its surrounding areas, and the Laurentian sector of Laurussia during and after its integration within Pangea, together with new palaeogeographical maps from the Cambrian to the end of the Permian. On those maps there are plotted areas of land, shallow shelf, deeper shelf and oceans derived from much pre-existing data, as well as reefs, volcanic and plutonic rocks and some selected faunas and ﬂoras. The substantial number of terranes at the margins of the continent through time are brieﬂy reviewed, notably those in Mexico, the Appalachians, and northwestern parts of Europe which were once parts of Laurentia. The many terranes containing Palaeozoic rocks in the northwestern part of the North American Plate, and forming much of the Cordillera in northwest Canada and Alaska as well as northeast Siberia, are itemised: some were periLaurentian, some peri-Siberian, and others originally oceanic in the Palaeozoic. The concept of an Arctida Microcontinent is discussed. That microcontinent had originally been postulated as existing from the Neoproterozoic to the Devonian, and to have consisted of the composite Arctic Alaska and the Seward, York and Farewell terranes in Alaska, and the Pearya Terrane of Ellesmere Island, as well as the Chukotka Peninsula, New Siberian Islands, Severnaya Zemlya, northern Taimyr and adjacent areas now in the northeast of modern Siberia. Many parts of that area contain faunas of both Siberian and Laurentian aspect, which are reviewed and analysed. It is concluded that there was a smaller independent continent in the Lower Palaeozoic, which was originally somewhere between Siberia and Laurentia in the Cambrian, but which did not include the New Siberian Islands, Kolyma and Omolon (which were parts of Siberia), Severnaya Zemlya and northern Taimyr (the independent Kara Microcontinent), or the Farewell Terrane (independent until the Mesozoic). The eastern end of that Arctic Alaska–Chukotka Microcontinent docked with northwestern Laurussia (Ellesmerian margin) in the Devonian, but it did not reach its present position within North America until after rotation in the Cretaceous. The Cordilleran terranes of Wrangellia, Alexander and some smaller units are conﬁrmed as having existed as another microcontinent independent from North America until the Mesozoic. However, there appear to be no terranes now in western North America which originated from Baltica. The Pearya Terrane, now forming northern Ellesmere Island, was probably involved in the most northerly sector of the Silurian Caledonide Orogeny.},

	abstract = {The thin-skin Sevier and thick-skin Laramide belts of the North American Cordillera provide a long-term record of the interrelations between evolving styles of mountain building and plate dynamics over a complete tectonic cycle, from onset of rapid subduction, to protracted growth of a composite orogenic system, to ﬁnal collapse. Primary architecture of basement and sedimentary cover rocks, which included a thick passive margin section deposited along the western continental margin, inﬂuenced patterns of subsequent deformation. The Cordilleran orogenic system, comprised of an interrelated forearc accretionary complex, magmatic arc, retroarc hinterland, Sevier fold-thrust belt, and foreland basin locally deformed by Laramide arches, developed during Jurassic to Paleogene Andean-style subduction and terrane accretion. The Sevier belt formed as a foreland-propagating (west to east) wedge mostly during Cretaceous to Paleogene time, and included a western thrust system with aerially extensive thrust sheets that carried thick passive margin strata, and an eastern thrust system that carried thinner strata. Within the Wyoming salient of the Sevier belt, major thrust and fold traces display systematic map-view curvature about an average N–S structural trend, reﬂecting a component of primary curvature related to sedimentary prism architecture, followed by 60–80\% vertical-axis rotation of thrust sheets related to curved fault slip and interaction with Laramide arches at the salient ends. Internal deformation in the western thrust sheets was limited within strong shallower levels, whereas deeper levels underwent shear and vertical ﬂattening near a weak basal fault zone. Internal deformation in the eastern thrust sheets included widespread early layerparallel shortening (LPS), followed by concentration of slip onto weak fault zones. Approximately 200 km of thinskin shortening in the Sevier belt was transferred into lower crustal thickening and uplift of an orogenic plateau in the hinterland to the west. Synorogenic strata were deposited in an evolving foreland basin to the east that formed during ﬂexural loading of thrust sheets and regional dynamic subsidence during subduction. Overall E-oriented shortening in the Sevier belt is interpreted to reﬂect increased gravitational potential energy and evolving topographic slopes from a hinterland plateau through a growing thrust wedge. Laramide basementcored arches and intervening basins developed during later Cretaceous to Paleogene time, overlapping with younger stages of Sevier deformation. Arches and associated reverse faults display a wide range of trends within an overall NW–SE oriented, anastomosing network, partly reﬂecting primary basement heterogeneities. Limited vertical-axis rotations were localized along obliquely trending arch forelimbs and near arch intersections. Internal deformation in the foreland included limited LPS that refracted near variably trending arches. Laramide deformation was spatially and temporally correlated with a region of ﬂat-slab subduction, recorded by changes in magmatic and subsidence patterns. Overall ENE-oriented shortening in the Laramide belt was at low angles to relative plate motion, likely reﬂecting increased plate coupling near a cratonic lithosphere keel. An integrated model for tectonic evolution of the Sevier and Laramide belts includes: inﬂuence of primary sedimentary architecture and basement weaknesses; enhanced plate coupling from increased overriding plate motion, fast convergence rates, and development of a ﬂat-slab segment; linkage of upper crustal shortening in the Sevier belt with lower crustal thickening and uplift of a hinterland plateau; interaction between frontal thrusts in the Sevier belt and Laramide arches with differently oriented stress ﬁelds; concentrated slip along weak fault zones; redistribution of mass by erosion and deposition of synorogenic strata; and a switch to orogenic collapse during decreased convergence rates and slab removal.},

	abstract = {The Nevadan orogeny was a very shortlived event in the Late Jurassic that involved the deformation of a great variety of rock types and Paleozoic and Mesozoic terranes throughout the extent of the Sierra Nevada. The Nevadan structures show great variation in style but relatively constant orientations. These relations can be explained by considering the prior histories of the various terranes. Slaty cleavages and tight folds are the characteristic main-phase structures in the western belt of Jurassic island-arc volcanic rocks and flysch-type sedimentary rocks. A strip of phyllites and greenschists along the eastern edge of the belt apparently represents similar Jurassic rocks that were deformed and metamorphosed at greater depths, probably during underthrusting of the western belt beneath the central belt. The central belt of Paleozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks shows the most extreme variation in style of main-phase structures, from weak, spaced to crenulation cleavages in the south, where polyphase deformed rocks formed a structural basement, to slaty and phyllitic cleavages and asymmetric to isoclinal folds in the north, where most of the Paleozoic basement rocks lack penetrative pre-Nevadan fabrics. Eastward-directed thrust faulting apparently was important only in the northern part of the range, where main-phase deformation was most intense. The eastern belt of Jurassic and Triassic magmatic arc-volcanic and sedimentary rocks defines the core of a major synclinorium, and the rocks contain penetrative slaty cleavages and asymmetric, tight to isoclinal folds.},

Both H/V and phase velocity measurements exhibit consistent patterns related to the geologic units. Sedimentary basins—CSE and Plateau Central basins—show higher H/V values, while mountain areas—Massif de la Selle, Chaine des Matheux, Montagnes Noires and Massif de Nord—exhibit lower H/V. Regarding phase velocity, higher velocities are observed in northern and southern Haiti, likely reflecting the thinner crust compared to the thicker crust showing lower velocities in the central part. While our Vs model is consistent with previous model that suggested thinner crustal thickness in the northern and southern Haiti, with thickening in the center, the Moho interface in the central domain might be shallower than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Interstation cross correlations of ambient seismic noise from 1 year of continuous data at periods between 6 and 50 s are used to study the origin of the ambient noise using stations located in Europe, southern Africa, Asia, and three regions within North America. The signal‐to‐noise ratios (SNR) of Rayleigh waves for positive and negative correlation time lags at periods of 8, 14, 25 and 50 s are used to determine the azimuthal distribution of strong ambient noise sources. Ambient noise in both the primary (10–20 s) and secondary microseism bands (5–10 s) comes dominantly from the directions of relatively nearby coastlines with stronger noise occurring in the Northern Hemisphere in northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere in southern winter, consistent with the hypothesis that oceanic microseisms are generating this noise. The observed differences in the directivity of noise in the primary and secondary microseism bands are the consequence of propagation and attenuation, rather than the location of generation. At intermediate and long periods ({\textgreater}20 s), there is much less seasonal variation in both signal strength and directivity. We argue that our results are explained most simply by near‐coastal sources rather than deep ocean sources at all periods. Although the dominant ambient noise sources are distributed inhomogeneously in azimuth, strong ambient noise emerges from most directions when using recordings that are 1 year in duration. Simulations illustrate that this is what ensures the accuracy of the empirical Green's functions and ambient noise tomography.},

	abstract = {The record of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic waves is essential to detect, identify, and localize sources of both natural and anthropogenic origin. To guarantee traceability and inter-station comparability, as well as an estimation of the measurement uncertainties leading to a better monitoring of natural disasters and environmental aspects, suitable measurement standards and reliable calibration procedures of sensors, especially in the low-frequency range down to 0.01 Hz, are required. Most of all with regard to the design goal of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation’s International Monitoring System, which requires the stations to be operational nearly 100\% of the time, the on-site calibration during operation is of special importance. The purpose of this paper is to identify suitable excitation sources and elaborate necessary requirements for on-site calibrations. We give an extensive literature review of a large variety of anthropogenic and natural sources of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic waves, describe their most prominent features regarding signal and spectral characteristics, explicitly highlight some source examples, and evaluate the reviewed sources with respect to requirements for onsite calibrations such as frequency bandwidth, signal properties as well as the applicability in terms of cost–benefit. According to our assessment, earthquakes stand out across all three waveform technologies as a good natural excitation signal meeting the majority of the requirements. Furthermore, microseisms and microbaroms allow a calibration at very low frequencies. We also find that in each waveform technique man-made controlled sources such as drop weights or air guns are in good agreement with the required properties, although limitations may arise regarding the practicability. Using these sources, procedures will be established allowing calibration without record interrupting, thereby improving data quality and the identification of treaty-related events.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging ﬁeld of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency–time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be ﬂexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a signiﬁcant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

	abstract = {We present a new method of surface wave tomography based on applying the eikonal equation to observed phase traveltime surfaces computed from seismic ambient noise. The source–receiver reciprocity in the ambient noise method implies that each station can be considered to be an effective source and the phase traveltime between that source and all other stations is used to track the phase front and construct the phase traveltime surface. Assuming that the amplitude of the waveform varies smoothly, the eikonal equation states that the gradient of the phase traveltime surface can be used to estimate both the local phase speed and the direction of wave propagation. For each location, we statistically summarize the distribution of azimuthally dependent phase speed measurements based on the phase traveltime surfaces centred on different effective source locations to estimate both the isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic phase speeds and their uncertainties. Examples are presented for the 12 and 24 s Rayleigh waves for the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array stations in the western USA. We show that (1) the major resulting tomographic features are consistent with traditional inversion methods, (2) reliable uncertainties can be estimated for both the isotropic and anisotropic phase speeds, (3) ‘resolution’ can be approximated by the coherence length of the phase speed measurements and is about equal to the station spacing, (4) no explicit regularization is required in the inversion process and (5) azimuthally dependent phase speed anisotropy can be observed directly without assuming its functional form.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise tomography (ANT) has recently become a popular tomography method to study crustal structures thanks to its unique capability to extract short-period surface waves. Empirically, in order to reliably measure surface wave dispersion curves from time-domain cross-correlations, interstation distances between a pair of stations have to be longer than two/three wavelengths. This requirement imposed a strong constraint on the use of ANT at the long-period end at local- and regional-scale tomography studies. In this study, we use ambient noise data from USArray/Transportable Array recorded during 2007–2012 to investigate whether dispersion measurements from cross-correlations of ambient noise at short interstation distances are consistent with those at long distances and whether the shortpath dispersion measurements can be used in tomography, especially in local- and regionalscale tomography. Our results show that: (1) surface wave phase velocity dispersion curves measured by a frequency-time analysis technique (FTAN) from time-domain cross-correlations are consistent with those measured by a spectral method tracing the zero crossings of the real part of cross-spectrum functions in frequency domain; (2) dispersion measurements from time-domain cross-correlations with short interstation distances, up to only one wavelength, are consistent with and also reliable as those with interstation distances longer than three wavelengths and (3) these short-path measurements can be included in ANT to improve path coverage and resolution.},

Synthetic tests demonstrate that our joint inversion can retrieve the input sedimentary models better than inversions with surface or body wave data alone. We apply our method to waveform data of two broadband stations inside the Songliao Basin in northeast China to invert for sedimentary structures beneath the two stations. We verify our results by successfully isolating the Moho P‐to‐S conversion from sediment reverberations in surface receiver functions with a waveﬁeld‐downward‐continuation technique.

The array was composed of more than 5200 stations with an average spacing close to 100 m. Three weeks of passive ambient noise were crosscorrelated between each station pair, which resulted in more than 13.5 million crosscorrelations within the area. Clear fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves were observed between 0.5 and 4 Hz, which were most sensitive to structure above 1-km depth. For each station pair, we applied frequency-time analysis to determine the phase traveltime dispersion, and, for each frequency, we applied eikonal tomography to determine the Rayleigh wave phase velocity map. The eikonal tomography accounted for ray bending by tracking the wavefront and allowed uncertainties to be estimated through statistical analysis. The compilation of phase velocity maps was then used to invert for 3D shear velocity structure. The inverted model showed clear correlation with the known geologic features such as the shallow south–north velocity dichotomy and a deeper fast anomaly associated with the NewportInglewood fault zone. Our results can potentially be used to complement traditional active source studies.},

	abstract = {We construct an improved shear wave velocity (Vs) model of the southern Californian crust and uppermost mantle by performing an adjoint tomographic inversion using Rayleigh wave empirical Green’s functions (EGFs) at 5–50 s periods from ambient noise cross correlations. Our initial model is the isotropic Vs model M16 from Tape et al., which was generated by three-component seismograms at 2–30 s periods from local earthquake data. Synthetic Green’s functions (SGFs) from M16 show good agreement with the EGFs at 5–10 and 10–20 s period bands, but they have an average 2.1 s time advance at 20–50 s. By minimizing the traveltime differences between the EGFs and SGFs using a gradient-based algorithm, we successively reﬁne the Vs model, and the total misﬁt is reduced by ∼ 76.6 per cent from 1.75 to 0.41 after ﬁve iterations. Relative to M16, our new Vs model reveals: (1) a lower crust (20–30 km) with the mean Vs about 6 per cent slower; (2) a faster Vs speed in the middle and lower crust at depths greater than 10 km in the regions beneath the Los Angeles Basin and Central Transverse Range; (3) higher Vs in the lower crust beneath the westernmost Peninsular Range Batholith (PRB); and an enhanced high-velocity zone in the middle crust beneath Salton Trough Basin. Our updated model also reveals reﬁned lateral velocity gradients across PRB, Sierra Nevada Batholith and San Andreas Fault. Our study demonstrates the improvement of lateral coverage and depth sensitivity from using ambient noise instead of only earthquake data. The numerical spectral-element solver used in adjoint tomography provides accurate structural sensitivity kernels, and hence generates more robust images than those by traditional ambient noise tomography based on ray theory.},

	abstract = {We present a new 3-D seismic model of the western United States crust derived from a joint inversion of Rayleigh-wave phase velocity and ellipticity measurements using periods from 8 to 100 s. Improved constraints on upper-crustal structure result from use of short-period Rayleigh-wave ellipticity, or Rayleigh-wave H/V (horizontal to vertical) amplitude ratios, measurements determined using multicomponent ambient noise cross-correlations. To retain the amplitude ratio information between vertical and horizontal components, for each station, we perform daily noise pre-processing (temporal normalization and spectrum whitening) simultaneously for all three components. For each station pair, amplitude measurements between cross-correlations of different components (radial–radial, radial–vertical, vertical–radial and vertical–vertical) are then used to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at the two station locations. We use all EarthScope/USArray Tranportable Array data available between 2007 January and 2011 June to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios and their uncertainties at all station locations and construct new Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio maps in the western United States between periods of 8 and 24 s. Combined with previous longer period earthquake Rayleighwave H/V ratio measurements and Rayleigh-wave phase velocity measurements from both ambient noise and earthquakes, we invert for a new 3-D crustal and upper-mantle model in the western United States. Correlation between the inverted model and known geological features at all depths suggests good resolution in ﬁve crustal layers. Use of short-period Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio measurements based on noise cross-correlation enables resolution of distinct near surface features such as the Columbia River Basalt ﬂows, which overlie a thick sedimentary basin.},

	abstract = {We investigated upper crustal structure with data from a dense seismic array deployed around Mount St. Helens for 2 weeks in the summer of 2014. Interstation cross correlations of ambient seismic noise data from the array were obtained, and clear fundamental mode Rayleigh waves were observed between 2.5 and 5 s periods. In addition, higher-mode signals were observed around 2 s period. Frequency-time analysis was applied to measure fundamental mode Rayleigh wave phase velocities, which were used to invert for 2-D phase velocity maps. An azimuth-dependent traveltime correction was implemented to mitigate potential biases introduced due to an inhomogeneous noise source distribution. Reliable phase velocity maps were only obtained between 3 and 4 s periods due to limitations imposed by the array aperture and higher-mode contamination. The phase velocity tomography results, which are sensitive to structure shallower than 6 km depth, reveal an {\textasciitilde}10–15\% low-velocity anomaly centered beneath the volcanic ediﬁce and peripheral high-velocity anomalies that likely correspond to cooled igneous intrusions. We suggest that the low-velocity anomaly reﬂects the high-porosity mixture of lava and ash deposits near the surface of the ediﬁce, a highly fractured magmatic conduit and hydrothermal system beneath the volcano, and possibly a small contribution from silicate melt.},

	abstract = {The application results of the receiver function technique are briefly outlined. The topography of the main seismic boundaries in the mantle transition zone is evaluated with resolution of about 3 km in depth and about 200 km laterally. The maximal amplitudes of depth variations of the main boundaries reach tens of kilometers. The mantle transition zone thinning in the hot spots and the respective increase in temperature by {\textasciitilde}100 °C is established. In several regions, two low-velocity layers are revealed in the mantle transition zone, one directly above the 410-km seismic discontinuity and another at a depth of 450 to 500 km. The origin of the first layer is associated with dehydration in the mantle plumes during olivine – walesite phase transformation. The increase in the S-wave velocity at the base of the second layer can explain the observations of the so-called 520-km boundary. The traditional approach to studying the structure of the crust and upper mantle is from surface waves. Receiver functions can provide higher resolution at the same depths when a combination of P- and S-wave receiver functions is used. This type of results was obtained for Fennoscandia, Kaapvaal craton, Indian shield, Central Tien Shan, Baikal rift zone, the Azores, Cape Verde Islands, and the western Mediterranean. S-receiver functions were used in the studies of the lunar crust. The joint P- and S-receiver function inversion provides robust estimates of the parameters of seismic boundaries including weak discontinuities such as the lithosphere – asthenosphere interface of cratons. The parameters determined from receiver functions include the P- to S-wave velocity ratio. In a few regions, a very high ({\textgreater} 2.0) velocity ratio is observed in the lower crust, probably indicating the presence of a fluid with high pore pressure. Receiver functions allow estimating the parameters of azimuthal anisotropy as a function of depth. The changes of the parameters with depth make it possible to distinguish the active anisotropy associated with recent deformations from the frozen anisotropy – the effect of the past tectonic processes.},

	abstract = {The lower boundary of the lithospheric plates has remained as an enigmatic boundary for seismologists, since it is relatively poorly observed by seismic means. There is traditionally a broad consensus that the asthenosphere is observable as a low velocity zone by seismic surface waves. Seismic techniques which use shorter period P-to-S or S-to-P converted body waves are now far enough developed to be successful in observing such a low velocity zone with a higher resolution. The principle of this technique (the so-called receiver function technique) is that a strong teleseismic mother phase (e.g. P, S, PP or SKS) incident from below on any seismic discontinuity beneath a station produces a converted phase (Ps or Sp) which indicates its depth and properties. We discuss details of this technique. A sufﬁcient number of such observations exist already to indicate that the top of the low velocity zone is a globally observable discontinuity and it is sharper than previously thought. An intriguing observation is that in some cratons the new seismic data indicate that the low velocity zone exists already at shallower depths than obtained from surface waves. This conﬁrms earlier results from controlled source observations (Thybo and Perchuc, 1997). We discuss possible interpretations of this shallow low velocity zone in cratonic regions.},

The direct P wave and the P-to-S converted phase vary strongly with backazimuth producing an apparent delay in first arriving energy at western backazimuths. These patterns are attributed to a shallow contact between low-velocity sandstones at the surface and an underlying highvelocity volcanic unit.

	abstract = {We image the thermochemical structure of crust and mantle underneath the North American continent by inverting recordings of P-to-s (Ps) and S-to-p (Sp) converted seismic body waves (receiver functions [RFs]). Through careful data selection and processing, we construct a multifrequency Ps (5-, 8-, and 10 -s) and Sp (10- and 15- s) RF data set from USArray recordings. The inversion is interfaced with petrological phase equilibria computations to build self-consistent radial seismic velocity and density models for RF waveform simulations. Inverted models are combined through back-projection along converted raypaths and interpolation to tomographic images of crust and mantle structure. Through clustering analysis we identify three major tectonic regions based on mantle thermochemical and seismic structure: the tectonically active West (TAW), the central transition region (CTR), and the cratonic-orogenic East (COE). TAW is chemically more fertile with a Mg\# ∼ 0.90 (molar Mg\# = Mg/(Mg + Fe)) and characterized by an elevated mantle potential temperature of 1490 ± 27◦C relative to COE, which is chemically more depleted (Mg\# ∼ 0.91) and colder (1419 ± 27◦C). CTR is intermediate to TAW and COE. We find significant thermochemically induced topography associated with the base of the lithosphere (±90 km), while the mantle transition zone is mostly influenced by thermally induced topography on the 410-km discontinuity (±15 km). In contrast, the 660-km discontinuity, where variations are only ±5 km, reflects a more complex thermochemical interplay. To place the results in a tectonic context, thermobarometric estimates from basaltic rocks across the western United States are integrated with the seismic inversions to produce a thermal model of the underlying mantle.},

	abstract = {Seismic anisotropy beneath eastern North America, as expressed in shear wave splitting observations, has been attributed to plate motion-parallel shear in the asthenosphere, resulting in fast axes aligned with the plate motion. However, deviations of fast axes from plate motion directions are observed near major tectonic boundaries of the Appalachians, indicating contributions from lithospheric anisotropy associated with past tectonic processes. In this study, we conduct anisotropic receiver function (RF) analysis using data from a dense seismic array traversing the New England Appalachians in Connecticut to examine anisotropic layers in the crust and upper mantle and correlate them with past tectonic processes as well as present-day mantle flow. We use the harmonic decomposition method to separate directionally-dependent variations of RFs and focus on features with the same harmonic signals observed across multiple stations. Within the crust, there are multiple features that may be correlated with stratification in the Hartford Basin, faults in the Taconic thrust belt, shear zones formed during Salinic/Acadian terrane accretion events, and orogen-parallel crustal flow in the Acadian orogenic plateau. We apply a Bayesian inversion method to obtain quantitative constraints on the direction and strength of intra-crustal anisotropy beneath the Hartford Basin. In the upper mantle, we identify a fossil shear zone possibly formed during oblique subduction of Rheic Ocean lithosphere. We also find evidence for a plate motion-parallel flow zone in the asthenosphere that is likely disturbed by mantle upwelling near the southern margin of the Northern Appalachian Anomaly in the eastern part of the study area.},

	abstract = {We applied ambient noise tomography to continuous data recorded by a dense seismic array deployed on the volcanic island of Lipari in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea. Since most of Lipari's seismicity occurs offshore and is not evenly distributed, this technique allowed us to obtain the first high-resolution images beneath the island down to ∼2.5 km depth. Results show a complex seismic structure related to the various ages and compositions of the volcanic products characteristic of the different regions of the island. High shear wave velocities are found in western Lipari, where active hydrothermal vents and N-S faults are mapped. Low wave speeds are revealed beneath southern and northeastern Lipari, where more recent volcanic activity developed along N-S dike-like structures that are aligned with rhyolitic vents. We suggest these dikes likely represent the probable pathways of future volcanic eruptions.},

ABSTRACT = {The Pacific–North American plate boundary in California is composed of a 400-km-wide network of faults and zones of distributed deformation. Earthquakes, even large ones, can occur along individual or combinations of faults within the larger plate boundary system. While research often focuses on the primary and secondary faults, holistic study of the plate boundary is required to answer several fundamental questions. How do plate boundary motions partition across California faults? How do faults within the plate boundary interact during earthquakes? What fraction of strain accumulation is relieved aseismically and does this provide limits on fault rupture propagation? Geodetic imaging, broadly defined as measurement of crustal deformation and topography of the Earth’s surface, enables assessment of topographic characteristics and the spatio-temporal behavior of the Earth’s crust. We focus here on crustal deformation observed with continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from NASA’s airborne UAVSAR platform, and on high-resolution topography acquired from lidar and Structure from Motion (SfM) methods. Combined, these measurements are used to identify active structures, past ruptures, transient motions, and distribution of deformation. The observations inform estimates of the mechanical and geometric properties of faults. We discuss five areas in California as examples of different fault behavior, fault maturity and times within the earthquake cycle: the M6.0 2014 South Napa earthquake rupture, the San Jacinto fault, the creeping and locked Carrizo sections of the San Andreas fault, the Landers rupture in the Eastern California Shear Zone, and the convergence of the Eastern California Shear Zone and San Andreas fault in southern California. These examples indicate that distribution of crustal deformation can be measured using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and high-resolution topography and can improve our understanding of tectonic deformation and rupture characteristics within the broad plate boundary zone.},

    abstract = {We present the results of Rayleigh wave and Love wave phase velocity tomography in the western United States using ambient seismic noise observed at over 250 broad-band stations from the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array and regional networks. All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency—time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s. The maps show clear correlations with major geological structures and qualitative agreement with previous results based on Rayleigh wave group speeds.},
